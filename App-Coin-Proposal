App Coin Mining Proposal

App Coin is a low float, high utility, fair launch token powering the economic engine of the Think network.

App Coins can be used to purchase exclusive pools of tokenized Apps, and become the first users and holders of a growing suite of tokenized software incubated to work with the Think Agent Standard. Tokens will initially be off chain, and a vote will be cast before decentralizing the App Coin protocol via tokens.

A vote of the Think  holders passed (100:18) with a directive to initiate off-chain mining on Oct 23rd, 2025.
Maximum App Coins minted: 21 million
Starting emissions: ~219,150 APP / mo
Halving period: 48 months
Token schedule: see “ Monthly Token Schedule” in appendix

Mining Emissions:
The mining emissions are split amongst those staking Think based on “weights”— a concept used in training neural networks. 
Tokens are emitted to users  monthly based on: $APP mined * (Your weights / All weights). 
*All weights refers to the total quantity of staked THINK Token

How your weights are determined:
Your weights = your $THINK staked x your Network Power

Your Network Power = $Think staked x Multiplier

Proposed Multipliers (In community discussion):

No Genesis Think Agent: 100%*
1 Genesis Think Agent: 150%
2 Genesis Think Agent: 170%
3 Genesis Think Agent: 185%
4 Genesis Think Agent: 195%
5 Genesis Think Agent: 200%


APP Coin Uses:
APP Coins will be used to participate in an incubated project’s presale.

The presale window will be open for a set period of time (example: 1 week) and users will be able to contribute their app tokens to a pot. For example, the first project has committed 3% (30 million tokens) of their token supply to the APP Coin pool.

The APP Coins are exchanged for an ERC1155 (gas-optimized) soul-bound NFT that represents 1 APP Coin contribution. The project will send the tokens to be distributed (via claim) to these holders.

With the above example, if 500,000 APP Coins are contributed to the 3% pot, each APP Coin would receive 60 project tokens.
